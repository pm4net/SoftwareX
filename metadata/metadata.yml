description: pm4net is a collection of software libraries and applications to enable
  the fusion of Structured Log Analysis and Object-Centric Process Mining. It consists
  of an implementation of the OCEL standard and related CLI, a Serilog sink and an
  enricher to enable logging to OCEL files, a process mining library to enable process
  discovery upon such log files, a web application to ingest, modify, and visualise
  the log files from object-centric perspectives. And finally, a benchmarking suite
  for testing of scalability.
